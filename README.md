This study aimed to predict the number of accidents in 2024 using various machine learning models while addressing the critical issue of data transparency. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle (1980-2023) and additional data from various organizations, this research provided a more robust foundation for predictive analysis compared to previous studies. The methodology involved data preprocessing, training multiple models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—and evaluating their performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity.
Among the models tested, Linear Regression emerged as the most reliable for predicting accidents, with an accuracy of 88.89%, perfect precision, and a balanced recall. Its estimate of 406 accidents in 2024 was more conservative and aligned with real-world trends, making it an effective tool for policy planning and resource allocation. The SVM model, while offering similar accuracy, predicted a higher number of accidents, indicating a possible tendency towards overestimation. Random Forest, despite its perfect recall, demonstrated poor precision and accuracy, which limited its practical use for precise accident prediction.
The study highlights the significance of model selection in forecasting accident occurrences and the need for transparency in data collection and preprocessing. By addressing the gaps in previous research, this work contributes to a more transparent and data-driven approach for understanding accident trends. The findings can assist policymakers, urban planners, and safety organizations in making informed decisions to enhance public safety and mitigate accident risks in 2024 and beyond. Future research could explore hybrid models or integrate additional factors like weather conditions and traffic patterns to further refine predictions and improve model accuracy.
